## Description
A personal finance app that aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to manage their finances. The app will have both a mobile and web side, with an elegant user interface that enhances the user experience.

Users will be able to register/login to the app - input their income and report their expenses manually or by using Plaid, a financial data platform that connects to users' bank accounts. This feature will enable users to keep track of their income and spending and make informed financial decisions.

This app utilizes MERN stack and MONGODB ATLAS

## My Role
My role in this project was working with the backend. I helped create and maintain the MONGO DB ATLAS, Created the API endpoints which include basic CRUD applications as well as email verification and password recovery,
I also made the yaml on swaggerhub which tested these api endpoints. This project helped introduce me to creating an application using the MERN stack
